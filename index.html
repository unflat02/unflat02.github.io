                <p>Hey there! </p>            
                <p>My name is Chloe Unflat and I am a Design Major and User Experience (UX) Minor at Western Washington University. I am an avid learner of all things (from new recipes to incredibly useless skills). I love to read, dance in the kitchen, and explore by running, climbing, swimming, and frolicking around new and known places. I am eager to try new things, win at most board games, and go out into the world to spread some spunky energy:) </p> <!--150 word bio-->

                <p> Here are some things I like to do:</p>

                        <h4>Get Outside</h4>
                        <p>I really like to spend time outside exploring with friends. Climbing, running, hiking, backpacking, kayaking, swimming, and exploring all bring me so much joy. It's nice to slow down and spend time outside. On this trip, we went around three lakes and I got a flat tire.</p>

                        <h4>Listen to Music</h4>
                        <p>I love to go see live music. As a kid, this started by spending time in the kitchen listening to music with my dad, then he would take me out to see live performances. This year, my goal is to go to more shows. I just went up to Canada to see the Vista Kicks with some friends.</p>

                        <p>Yay, food is yummy. I'm always trying new recipes, making ones I learned as a kid, and making them up! This is a picuture of some korean food I made this summer. We got some cumcumber salad, kimchee, bok choy, and braised tofu going on. #getinmybelly</p>

                        <p>When I get the chance to go back home to Portland, I love to hang out with my siblings. We like to go to the Portland Art Museum, play board games, and go on hike and walks around our neighborhood. We get along, most of the time...</p>

                        <p>Once a month, (more often when it gets warmer), I jump in the bay. I call it my jump of the month. I try my best to get friends, and sometimes strangers, to join me. It us a great way to feel grounded.</p>

                        <p>When I'm not hiding in the design building, you'll probably find me on campus on Harrington field. I am a member of the Western women's soccer program. I like to think of it as adult recess, with a little extra fitness.</p>
